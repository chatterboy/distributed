# distributed

This is a private directory (but everyone can see) for the distributed operating system to save remotely.

# queue directory

This is a directory for homework that we have to implement two queues of both standard queue and concurrent

queue. 

In this directory, you can look over a queue.cpp file that implement two queues and check the execution time.

To do this you need to compile with following a command for modern c++.

$ g++ -std=c++11 -pthread -o queue queue.cpp

after that you run the executable file with following a command.

$ ./queue
